### Here are my Arch+Hyprland dotfiles!

This is primarily for me in case i somehow screw up big time and loose these.

Lets pretend dotfiles could ever be done, which we all know they cant: This is far from being anywhere close to being near to being done. Reason for this is how i configure everything which is by only changing stuff that annoys me.

I dont know why you would try out my dotfiles, so dont. Havent tested the "install" script, maybe it will break everything, idk use at your own risk. Also a lot of configs are missing because i only want to have selected configs here 

You can however look at my hyprland bindings config file, i believe there are some neat commands that do some cool stuff without requiring external scrips

No pictures because
a) nothing is special
b) looks close to defaults
c) I dont wanna put in the effort 



If you REALLY REALLY REALLY wanna use my configs you need to `cd` into this pc folder so python uses the right relative path and run the main script and enter `n` when the question appears. This SHOULD move everything to the right place (I DIDNT TEST IT!!!) and install all explicitly installed packages using yay. 

But again DONT TRY, at very least use a VM or clean setup you can overwrite again. This is meant as a last resort backup for me and me only
