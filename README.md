# My dot-ish files

This repo serves only as backup and maybe used for ease of sharing. The goal is NOT to distribute some cool configs

If you are looking for fancy dotfiles go search somewhere else :)


# (NAQ) Never asked questions and their answers because literally no one asked anything at any moment in time before 

## Are they outdated
Probably 

##  Automated install?
For my pc config yes, high risk, never tested before. Please dont

## What Distros
pc: Arch (self explanatory because what else)\
server1: RaspberryPiOS (Debian) \
server2: Debian

## Ehm actually half of the files arent dotfiles
If its a problem for you, im sorry but i dont care

## Will this work on my systems
I dont want to give you the slightest sliver of hope to not be held responsible for destroying your setup so: No this wont work on your setup, it will physically uninstall the CPU from your mainboard, burn your harddrive and thus delete all your files and certainly leak all your passwords or something. Just dont.
